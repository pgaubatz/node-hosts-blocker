# Hosts-Blocker

Hosts-Blocker can be used to block ads, malware and spyware using the [hosts file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_%28file%29).

It downloads, merges and sorts hosts files from a configurable list of URLs and generates a new hosts file that aggregates the content of all downloaded hosts files.
